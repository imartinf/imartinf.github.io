# It's me! Hi!

:wave: Hi! My name is Iv√°n and I am working on my PhD @ [THAU-ETSIT-UPM](https://die.upm.es/grupo_de_investigacion/1760/gth-grupo-de-tecnolog%C3%ADa-del-habla). My work is focused on modelling **human subjective perception** through **State of the Art AI Systems**. In particular, I study how to create computational models that mimic aspects of human perception: including **memorability**, **social perception** and **ad decoding**. This will help us to create better multimedia systems in the fields of social media, marketing and education, among others. This area of research involves knowledge from different fields, such as **computer vision**, **deep learning**, **natural language processing** and **audio processing**.

:material-music-note: My other passion besides AI is music, so you might catch me playing bass or any other instrument at campus or at any jam session in Madrid - or around the world! :earth_africa:
